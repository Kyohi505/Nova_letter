Hi my baby, I made this special letter so you can have a reminder on how much I care about you.

We've been through so much and i'm sorry for being too much of a hot-headed jerk a lot of the time, but please know that I appreciate you for still loving me even with all the flaws that I have and made me realize that I have a lot of things to improve on myself.

You are a wonderful person, you are not perfect but you try your best to become better. A lot of people care about you even if you tell yourself how alone you are, but no matter what you say i'll always be here for you. I want us to do a lot of things so you better keep on living. I'm proud that you made it through another day.
            
        I love you and Happy Birthday! :>
